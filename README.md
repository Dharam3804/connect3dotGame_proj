# connect3dotGame_proj
we have developed a 3 dot connect android app.
this is a two player game, where each player will get a chance one after the other. This game will be having a grid of 3 X 3 with a total of 9 cells. The players are supposed to fill each cell alternatively.
Once the 3 same color dot is found ,game is over the app will declare who won the game. If no one wins, it will declare that it was a draw match.
